# How does it work
#
# 1. the first time to create a file to record the last motified time,
#    that is the program start time.
# 2. recourse the directory, and use find command get the modified file
#    newer than the record file, if there's one, upload it with ncftpput.
# 3. if upload error was occurred, do not update the record file, and you
#    should run upload-script later time.

# Settins
#
# 1. Local settings
#    publish_dir is your emacs-wiki's publish dir, normal files under this 
#    dir will be checked. And DON'T forget the last "/".  
publish_dir=$HOME/workport/homesite/publish/

# file of recording the modified time, needless to change
ctf=$publish_dir.ctime.txt

# 2. Serve settings
#    eg 1. If the remote publish dir is the one when you login, just
#	   as this blow.DON'T forget the last "." 
#	   FTP="-u user -p passwd -P port www.ftp.com ." 
#    eg 2. Otherwise, likes me, but please remember  DOSEN'T need the
#	   last "/" 
#ftp="-E -u suchang -p google -P 21  suchang.50webs.com suchang.net"
#ftp="-E -u suchang.net -p google1928 -P 21 184.22.251.197 ."
ftp="-E -u lalawuer -p 1D938AD6041377 -P 21 98.126.108.114 web"

# 3. Backup

    cd $backup_dir
    tar -czf $store_dir/site.tar.gz $file_name
}

# travel the dir, and upload the modified files
travel()
{
    # get the relatid dir
    del=$(echo "$publish_dir" | wc -c)
    floor=$(echo "$PWD" | cut -c$del-)

    # upload the modified files newer than the $ctf
    echo "from /$floor"
    for files in $(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -cnewer $ctf -print)
    do
	ncftpput $ftp/$floor "$files"
	if [ $? -gt 0 ]; then	# if upload failure...
	    return $?
	fi
    done

    # scan the folders, and enter it
    for dir in *; do
	if [ -d $dir ]; then
	    cd $dir
	    travel
